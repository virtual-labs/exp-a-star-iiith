This experiment is structured to demonstrate the A* search algorithm applied on a simple graph search setting. It provides a step-by-step understanding of the A* algorithm, its heuristic function, and how it can be used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

## Objectives:
<!-- - **Understand the A\* search algorithm and explore heuristic functions:** Learn the working principles of the A* search algorithm and the role of heuristic functions in guiding the search process and how it influences the efficiency of finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
- **Visualize the search process and path history:** Observe the step-by-step search process of the A* algorithm on a graph, highlighting the nodes expanded, the path taken, and the heuristic values for each node. Understand how the A* algorithm keeps track of the path taken to reach a node and how it backtracks to find the optimal path from the start node to the goal node. -->
- **Master the A\* Search Algorithm**: Develop a thorough understanding of the A* search algorithm, including its step-by-step execution and the mathematical principles underlying its combination of cost (g(n)) and heuristic (h(n)) functions.

- **Explore the Role of Heuristics**: Analyze heuristic functions, their impact on the algorithm's performance, and how they influence the efficiency and optimality of the pathfinding process.

- **Visualize the Search Dynamics**: Observe and interpret the A* algorithm's operation through visual representations of node expansions, heuristic evaluations, and the evolving search tree.

- **Trace Path Reconstruction**: Understand how the A* algorithm tracks and reconstructs the shortest path from the start node to the goal node, emphasizing its use of priority queues and backtracking mechanisms.

- **Evaluate Algorithm Efficiency**: Compare the A* search algorithm's performance with other search algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra, BFS) in terms of computational complexity and optimality in different graph scenarios.
